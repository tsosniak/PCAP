1. What is a module?
A file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be later imported and used when necessary
a module is identified by its name.

Computer code has a tendency to grow
Growing code is in fact a growing problem. A larger code always means tougher maintenance.

Searching for bugs is always easier where the code is smaller

From decomposition perspective:
divide all the tasks among the developers;
join all the created parts into one working whole.

For example, a certain project can be divided into two main parts:
the user interface (the part that communicates with the user using widgets and a graphical screen)
the logic (the part processing data and producing results)

Each of these parts can be (most likely) divided into smaller ones, and so on. Such a process is often called decomposition.

Modules are the answer.

you are the module's user;
or: you are the module's supplier.


All these modules (provided at start by Python), along with the built-in functions, form the Python standard library

Each module consists of entities (like a book consists of chapters). These entities can be functions, variables, constants, classes, and objects.


2. Importing a module
The simplest way to import a particular module is to use the import instruction as follows:
import math

The clause contains:

the import keyword;
the name of the module which is subject to import.

The instruction may be located anywhere in your code, but it must be placed before the first use of any of the module's entities.

import math
import sys

or

import math, sys

The modules' list may be arbitrarily long.

3. Namespace
A namespace is a space (understood in a non-physical context) in which some names exist and the names don't conflict with each other
(i.e., there are not two different objects of the same name).

Inside a certain namespace, each name must remain unique.

If the module of a specified name exists and is accessible (a module is in fact a Python source file), Python imports its contents,
i.e., all the names defined in the module become known, but they don't enter your code's namespace.

put:

the name of the module (e.g., math)
a dot (i.e., .)
the name of the entity (e.g., pi)

Such a form clearly indicates the namespace in which the name exists.

import math
print(math.sin(math.pi/2))

Now we're going to show you how the two namespaces (yours and the module's one) can coexist.

import math


def sin(x):
    if 2 * x == pi:
        return 0.99999999
    else:
        return None


pi = 3.14

print(sin(pi/2))
print(math.sin(math.pi/2))


from math import pi

The instruction consists of the following elements:

the from keyword;
the name of the module to be (selectively) imported;
the import keyword;
the name or list of names of the entity/entities which are being imported into the namespace.

Note: no other entities are imported. Moreover, you cannot import additional entities using a qualification

!!!the imported symbols may supersede their previous definitions within the namespace!!!


Importing a module: *
from module import *
Such an instruction imports all entities from the indicated module.
Is it unsafe? Yes, it is - you may not be able to avoid name conflicts

Importing a module: the as keyword (aliasing)
Aliasing causes the module to be identified under a different name than the original. This may shorten the qualified names, too
import module as alias
e.g. import math as m
print(m.sin(m.pi/2))

!!!Note: after successful execution of an aliased import, the original module name becomes inaccessible and must not be used.!!!

The phrase name as alias can be repeated
from module import n as a, m as b, o as c

4. Key takeaways

1. If you want to import a module as a whole, you can do it using the import module_name statement. You are allowed to import more than one module at once using a comma-separated list. For example:

import mod1
import mod2, mod3, mod4


although the latter form is not recommended due to stylistic reasons, and it's better and prettier to express the same intention in more a verbose and explicit form, such as:

import mod2
import mod3
import mod4


2. If a module is imported in the above manner and you want to access any of its entities, you need to prefix the entity's name using dot notation. For example:

import my_module

result = my_module.my_function(my_module.my_data)


The snippet makes use of two entities coming from the my_module module: a function named my_function() and a variable named my_data. Both names must be prefixed by my_module. None of the imported entity names conflicts with the identical names existing in your code's namespace.


3. You are allowed not only to import a module as a whole, but to import only individual entities from it. In this case, the imported entities must not be prefixed when used. For example:

from module import my_function, my_data

result = my_function(my_data)


The above way - despite its attractiveness - is not recommended because of the danger of causing conflicts with names derived from importing the code's namespace.


4. The most general form of the above statement allows you to import all entities offered by a module:

from my_module import *

result = my_function(my_data)


Note: this import's variant is not recommended due to the same reasons as previously (the threat of a naming conflict is even more dangerous here).

5. You can change the name of the imported entity "on the fly" by using the as phrase of the import. For example:

from module import my_function as fun, my_data as dat

result = fun(dat)



Exercise 1

import mint


What is the proper form of the function's invocation?

Check
mint.make_money()



Exercise 2

You want to invoke the function make_money() contained in the module named mint. Your code begins with the following line:

5. Working with standard modules
dir() function
it is able to reveal all the names provided through a particular module
There is one condition: the module has to have been previously imported as a whole (i.e., using the import module instruction - from module is not enough).

The function returns an alphabetically sorted list containing all entities' names available in the module identified by a name passed to the function as an argument:
dir(module)

6. Math functions
from math import ceil, floor, trunc

x = 1.4
y = 2.6

print(floor(x), floor(y))
print(floor(-x), floor(-y))
print(ceil(x), ceil(y))
print(ceil(-x), ceil(-y))
print(trunc(x), trunc(y))
print(trunc(-x), trunc(-y))

7. Is there real randomness in computers?
Another module worth mentioning is the one named random
It delivers some mechanisms allowing you to operate with pseudorandom numbers.
"pseudo" - they all are calculated using very refined algorithms.

A random number generator takes a value called a seed, treats it as an input value, calculates a "random" number based on it
and produces a new seed value.
The length of a cycle in which all seed values are unique may be very long, but it isn't infinite - sooner or later the seed values will start repeating, and the generating values will repeat, too

The initial seed value, set during the program start, determines the order in which the generated values will appear.

The random factor of the process may be augmented by setting the seed with a number taken from the current time - this may ensure that each program launch will start from a different seed value

random() - produces a float number x coming from the range (0.0, 1.0) - in other words: (0.0 <= x < 1.0).

The seed function

The seed() function is able to directly set the generator's seed. We'll show you two of its variants:

seed() - sets the seed with the current time;
seed(int_value) - sets the seed with the integer value int_value.

!!! Due to the fact that the seed is always set with the same value, the sequence of generated values always looks the same. !!!


If you want integer random values, one of the following functions would fit better:

randrange(end)
randrange(beg, end)
randrange(beg, end, step)
randint(left, right)

The last function is an equivalent of randrange(left, right+1) - it generates the integer value i, which falls in the range [left, right] (no exclusion on the right side).

The choice and sample functions
It's a function named in a very suggestive way - choice:

choice(sequence)
sample(sequence, elements_to_choose)

Again, the output of the program is not predictable.


8. platform module
The platform module lets you access the underlying platform's data, i.e., hardware, operating system, and interpreter version information.

platform(aliased = False, terse = False)
aliased → when set to True (or any non-zero value) it may cause the function to present the alternative underlying layer names instead of the common ones;
terse → when set to True (or any non-zero value) it may convince the function to present a briefer form of the result (if possible)

from platform import platform

print(platform())
print(platform(1))
print(platform(0, 1))

Windows-10-10.0.19041-SP0
Windows-10-10.0.19041-SP0
Windows-10

9. The machine function
you may just want to know the generic name of the processor which runs your OS together with Python and your code

from platform import machine
print(machine())
>>> AMD64

10. The processor function
The processor() function returns a string filled with the real processor name (if possible).

from platform import processor
print(processor())
>>> Intel64 Family 6 Model 142 Stepping 12, GenuineIntel

11. The system function
A function named system() returns the generic OS name as a string.

from platform import system
print(system())
>>> Windows

12. The version function
The OS version is provided as a string by the version() function.

from platform import version
print(version())
>>> 10.0.19041

13. functions from platform module

python_implementation() → returns a string denoting the Python implementation (expect CPython here, unless you decide to use any non-canonical Python branch)

python_version_tuple() → returns a three-element tuple filled with:
the major part of Python's version;
the minor part;
the patch level number.

from platform import python_implementation, python_version_tuple

print(python_implementation())

for atr in python_version_tuple():
    print(atr)

>>> CPython

14. Python Module Index
You can read about all standard Python modules here: https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html.

15. Key takeaways

1. A function named dir() can show you a list of the entities contained inside an imported module. For example:

import os
dir(os)


prints out the list of all the os module's facilities you can use in your code.


2. The math module couples more than 50 symbols (functions and constants) that perform mathematical operations (like sine(), pow(), factorial()) or providing important values (like π and the Euler symbol e).


3. The random module groups more than 60 entities designed to help you use pseudo-random numbers. Don't forget the prefix "random", as there is no such thing as a real random number when it comes to generating them using the computer's algorithms.


4. The platform module contains about 70 functions which let you dive into the underlaying layers of the OS and hardware. Using them allows you to get to know more about the environment in which your code is executed.


5. Python Module Index (https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html is a community-driven directory of modules available in the Python universe. If you want to find a module fitting your needs, start your search there.

16. What is a package?
making many modules may cause a little mess - sooner or later you'll want to group your modules exactly in the same way as you've previously grouped functions - is there a more general container than a module?
yes, there is - it's a package; in the world of modules, a package plays a similar role to a folder/directory in the world of files.

A new subfolder has appeared - can you see it? Its name is __pycache__
There is a file named (more or less) module.cpython-xy.pyc where x and y are digits derived from your version of Python
When Python imports a module for the first time, it translates its contents into a somewhat compiled shape.
The file doesn't contain machine code - it's internal Python semi-compiled code,  ready to be executed by Python's interpreter
the execution starts faster, and runs faster, too.

Thanks to that, every subsequent import will go quicker than interpreting the source text from scratch.

Python is able to check if the module's source file has been modified (in this case, the pyc file will be rebuilt) or not (when the pyc file may be run at once). As this process is fully automatic and transparent, you don't have to keep it in mind.

When a module is imported, its content is implicitly executed by Python
Note: the initialization takes place only once, when the first import occurs, so the assignments done by the module aren't repeated unnecessarily.

Imagine the following context:

there is a module named mod1;
there is a module named mod2 which contains the import mod1 instruction;
there is a main file containing the import mod1 and import mod2 instructions.
At first glance, you may think that mod1 will be imported twice - fortunately, only the first import occurs. Python remembers the imported modules and silently omits all subsequent imports.

Python can do much more. It also creates a variable called __name__.
We can say that:

when you run a file directly, its __name__ variable is set to __main__;
when a file is imported as a module, its __name__ variable is set to the file's name (excluding .py)

A few elements need some explanation, we think:

the line starting with #! has many names - it may be called shabang, shebang, hashbang, poundbang or even hashpling (don't ask us why). The name itself means nothing here - its role is more important. From Python's point of view, it's just a comment as it starts with #. For Unix and Unix-like OSs (including MacOS) such a line instructs the OS how to execute the contents of the file (in other words, what program needs to be launched to interpret the text). In some environments (especially those connected with web servers) the absence of that line will cause trouble;
a string (maybe a multiline) placed before any module instructions (including imports) is called the doc-string, and should briefly explain the purpose and contents of the module;
the functions defined inside the module (suml() and prodl()) are available for import;
we've used the __name__ variable to detect when the file is run stand-alone, and seized this opportunity to perform some simple tests.

https://edube.org/learn/pe-2/modules-and-packages-34


17. how Python searches for modules?
from sys import path

There's a special variable (actually a list) storing all locations (folders/directories) that are searched in order to find a module which has been requested by the import instruction.
Python browses these folders in the order in which they are listed in the list - if the module cannot be found in any of these directories, the import fails.

The variable is named path, and it's accessible through the module named sys

Note: the folder in which the execution starts is listed in the first path's element

Note once again: there is a zip file listed as one of the path's elements - it's not an error. Python is able to treat zip files as ordinary folders - this can save lots of storage.

There are two questions to answer:
how do you transform such a tree (actually, a subtree) into a real Python package (in other words, how do you convince Python that such a tree is not just a bunch of junk files, but a set of modules)?
where do you put the subtree to make it accessible to Python?

The first question has a surprising answer: packages, like modules, may require initialization.
Python expects that there is a file with a very unique name inside the package's folder: __init__.py.
The content of the file is executed when any of the package's modules is imported. If you don't want any special initializations, you can leave the file empty, but you mustn't omit it.

Remember: the presence of the __init.py__ file finally makes up the package.

Note: it's not only the root folder that can contain __init.py__ file - you can put it inside any of its subfolders (subpackages) too
 It may be useful if some of the subpackages require individual treatment and special kinds of initialization.

sample - you can import modules's entities from .zip file too:
from sys import path
path.append('..\\packages\\extrapack.zip')
import extra.good.best.sigma as sig


18. Key takeaways

1. While a module is designed to couple together some related entities (functions, variables, constants, etc.), a package is a container which enables the coupling of several related modules under one common name. Such a container can be distributed as-is (as a batch of files deployed in a directory sub-tree) or it can be packed inside a zip file.


2. During the very first import of the actual module, Python translates its source code into the semi-compiled format stored inside the pyc files, and deploys these files into the __pycache__ directory located in the module's home directory.


3. If you want to instruct your module's user that a particular entity should be treated as private (i.e. not to be explicitly used outside the module) you can mark its name with either the _ or __ prefix. Don't forget that this is only a recommendation, not an order.


4. The names shabang, shebang, hasbang, poundbang, and hashpling describe the digraph written as #!, used to instruct Unix-like OSs how the Python source file should be launched. This convention has no effect under MS Windows.


5. If you want convince Python that it should take into account a non-standard package's directory, its name needs to be inserted/appended into/to the import directory list stored in the path variable contained in the sys module.


6. A Python file named __init__.py is implicitly run when a package containing it is subject to import, and is used to initialize a package and/or its sub-packages (if any). The file may be empty, but must not be absent.



Exercise 1

You want to prevent your module's user from running your code as an ordinary script. How will you achieve such an effect?

Check
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print "Don't do that!"
    sys.exit()



Exercise 2

Some additional and necessary packages are stored inside the D:\Python\Project\Modules directory. Write a code ensuring that the directory is traversed by Python in order to find all requested modules.

Check
import sys

# note the double backslashes!
sys.path.append("D:\\Python\\Project\\Modules")




Exercise 3

The directory mentioned in the previous exercise contains a sub-tree of the following structure:

abc
 |__ def
      |__ mymodule.py


Assuming that D:\Python\Project\Modules has been successfully appended to the sys.path list, write an import directive letting you use all the mymodule entities.

Check
import abc.def.mymodule


19. Python packaging ecosystem and how to use it
 Python has turned into a leader of research on artificial intelligence
 The most preferable and efficient thing is to enable all Python community members to freely exchange their codes and experiences
 In this model, nobody is forced to start work from scratch

 a centralized repository of all available software packages; and a tool allowing users to access the repository. Both these entities already exist and can be used at any time.
The repository (or repo for short) we mentioned before is named PyPI (it's short for Python Package Index)

The PyPI website (administered by PWG) is located at the address:
https://pypi.org/.

PyPI is completely free, and you can just pick a code and use it

pip - means “pip installs packages”

The MS Windows Python installer already contains pip
pip --version
pip3 --version

the absence of this message may mean that the PATH variable either incorrectly points to the location of the Python binaries, or doesn't point to it at all; for example, our PATH variable contains the following substring:

C:\Program Files\Python3\Scripts\;C:\Program Files\Python3\;


20. Dependencies
dependency is a phenomenon that appears every time you're going to use a piece of software that relies on other software

dependency hell.
pip can do all of this for you. Really. It can discover, identify, and resolve all dependencies. Moreover, it can do it in the cleverest way, avoiding any unnecessary downloads and reinstalls.

pip help

there’s a command that can tell you more about any of the installed packages
pip show package_name

Installation: Two possible scenarios may be put into action now:
you want to install a new package for you only – it won't be available for any other user (account) existing on your computer; this procedure is the only one available if you can’t elevate your permissions and act as a system administrator;
you’ve decided to install a new package system-wide – you have administrative rights and you're not afraid to use them.

To distinguish between these two actions, pip uses a dedicated option named --user (note the double dash). The presence of this option instructs pip to act locally on behalf of your (non-administrative) user.
If you don’t add this, pip assumes that you’re as a system administrator and it’ll do nothing to correct you if you’re not.

The pip install has two important additional abilities:

it is able to update a locally installed package – e.g., if you want to make sure that you’re using the latest version of a particular package, you can run the following command:

pip install -U package_name

it is able to install a user-selected version of a package (pip installs the newest available version by default); to achieve this goal you should use the following syntax:

pip install package_name==package_version
e.g.,

pip install pygame==1.9.2


21. Key takeaways

1. A repository (or repo for short) designed to collect and share free Python code exists and works under the name Python Package Index (PyPI) although it's also likely that you come across a very niche name The Cheese Shop. The Shop's website is available at https://pypi.org/.


2. To make use of The Cheese Shop the specialized tool has been created and its name is pip (pip installs packages while pip stands for... ok, don't mind). As pip may not be deployed as a part of standard Python installation, it is possible that you will need to install it manually. Pip is a console tool.


3. To check pip's version one the following commands should be issued:

pip --version


or

pip3 --version


Check yourself which of these works for you in your OS' environment.


4. List of main pip activities looks as follows:

pip help operation - shows brief pip's description;
pip list - shows list of currently installed packages;
pip show package_name - shows package_name info including package's dependencies;
pip search anystring - searches through PyPI directories in order to find packages which name contains anystring;
pip install name - installs name system-wide (expect problems when you don't have administrative rights);
pip install --user name - install name for you only; no other your platform's user will be able to use it;
pip install -U name - updates previously installed package;
pip uninstall name - uninstalls previously installed package;
